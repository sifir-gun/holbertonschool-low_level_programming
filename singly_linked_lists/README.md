# Singly Linked Lists in C

## Concepts
For this project, you are expected to look into the concept of **Data Structures**.

## Resources
Read or watch:
- [Linked Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/)
- Google
- YouTube

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- When and why to use linked lists vs arrays
- How to build and use linked lists

## Requirements
- **Editors allowed**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation**: Your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Code style**: Your code should use the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **No global variables** allowed
- **Maximum 5 functions per file**
- **Standard library functions allowed**: `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. No use of `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc. is allowed.
- **You are allowed to use** `_putchar`
- **Header file**: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `lists.h
